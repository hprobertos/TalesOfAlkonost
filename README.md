I do not own most of the content used in this project like: 
* Music 
* Images 
* Public code used. 

I do not earn money from this and the only purpose of it was to complete the corresponding course.

## History of the game
The point of the game is to escape a space facility solving the puzzles that appear in each level, by using math and logic skills. This game is for kids from 6-10.

## How to play
Every level changes the way to play the game. Some of the levels require the mouse, keyboard or both.

## Compatibility 
This game was developed to run in a computer running Windows 7 or above. It needs Java installed and some basic specs to run smoothly.

## Credit
You have all rights to use it as you wish, but I will be so grateful if you credit me for my hard work. Have fun!
